A Call of Duty:Black Ops administration tool written in c++ for linux/osx

Not finished cause i have no time anymore.


You will need boost regex and ncurses to get it work.

How to use?
Copy the .ini template and configure with your own settings.

Start with "gtm config.ini"


Multiple instances are possible.
Released under GPLv3!

Sorry if the indenting is f*cked up a bit. XCode is a bit lazy with indenting.
